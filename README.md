# WannaChain
A simple implementation of a block chain network.

## Introduction: 5 minutes into blockchain by code.

### 1. Block Chain
- A list of distributed chain of blocks accross a p2p/distributed network.

### 2. Block
 A single block in the chain that contains:
- Data: that is shared across network.
- MetaData: to verify the block. 

### 3. Contracts
 A set of rules those are agreed across the network:
 - Data Contract: rules to validate data of a block. (ex: bitcoin block data contains valid bitcoin transaction).
 - Block Contract: rules to validate meta data of a block. It's a like a mathematic problem needs to be solve in order to
 
### 4. Adding a new block (mining)
Collect valid data that is shared a cross network and create a new block that satifies the block contract.

### 5. Take a rest.
